# Carrera-OS

## Idea

In this project we want to develop custom controls for a Carrera slotcar. We accomplish this by mounting an ESP32 board onto the car to control the motor instead of the controllers that are connected to the track.

Further, we want to add a camera to the vehicle to see a live videofeed from the cockpit to enable first person driving.
